# Web-Developer-Notes

These are the notes I took in my Developer Career. Maybe I can help someone with them :D

Altough I'm Italian, I wrote this notes in English so that they can possibly reach more people.
You'll probably find a lot of typos and grammatical errors. If so, you can first tell me where you found the error, and then I'll immediately correct it.

The code examples are written in `Javascript`.

Feel free to give me any kind of feedback. I'll surely appreciate it, even if the feedback says that I'm a terrible developer and I should immeditely retire :D

Damn...

Enjoy the reading <3
