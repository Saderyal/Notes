# SEO

SEO stands for **Search Engine Optimization**, and nowadays is a really important topic if you want to make your website visible to other users.
The first link in a search usually get 67% more clicks of the others.
This is always where you want to be: _on the first position_ 🥇.

## Google Search

There are a ton of search engines, like Bing, Yahoo!, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Yandex, and so on.
However, the most used one is, of course, **Google Search** (90-92% usage).

Let's analyze for a moment what Google Search does:

> Google Search helps **billions** of people asking **trillions** of questions in **hundreds** of languages receive answers in **less than one second**.

I don't know about you, but it blows my mind.

How is it possible? How Google Search Work?
It first download a copy of the entire web, scans it, and make a list of all the words.
If you search "Lasagna", google will return all the websites where the word "Lasagna" is present from the most to the less useful.

It's algorithm is, of course, secret (otherwise someone could make easily appear its site in the first page, knowing how it works) and its frequentily changed (almost 6 changes every day).

> The quality of search results is determined on how your site follows specific criterias.

But, anyway, how is it so fast?
Conceptually, it's really simple: just a loooot of servers. Just that.
Each server has the whole WWW chopped in small pieces that you can query.
That's also why your results can change based on the location you are in.
Google has Data Centers everywhere, so that they can give you results as fast as possible.

## What is SEO?

Search Engine Optimization is a practice that improve the _quantity_ of people who visit your website and the _quality_ of your website (how much you are "affidable").
You can get **organic results** (good, certified, websites) and **paid results** (ADS, site that paid Google to be more visible).


## Current Google Ranking Factors ❗️

The factors that can most improve your Google Ranking are:

* Referring Domains
* Domain Authority
* Organic CTR
* Dwell Time & Bounce Rate
* Mobile Usability
* On-Page SEO
* Content Quality (E.A.T.)

We'll see each of them later on.

## The tree pillars of SEO

SEO is supported by three big pillars:

1. **Technical Strategy**
2. **Content Strategy**
3. **Off-site Strategy**

You can think of the **technical strategy** are the things that improve your website overall performance (such as navigation, loading, mobile usability).
It's so important that we will later cover more about that.

The **content strategy** is all about (just like the name says) the content of your site: the text, links, headings, images, and so on.

The **Off-site strategy**, finally, analyze the link in your website and how it's connected to external websites.

Each of them improve the SEO a LOT.

## SEO Myths

These are the 5 most common mythis in SEO, which are not true:

* ❌ Content is all you need.
* ❌ Page speed is not that important.
* ❌ Links are dead.
* ❌ High keyword density helps you rank.
* ❌ More pages help my site rank better

## Keyword research

What is a keyword? A keyword is a group of words used to search something. Google Search can "filter" what you want based on how you construct the keywords:

### Informational VS Commercial Search intents

There are Informational search Intent and Commercial search Intent.

Informational search Intent are used to find results that can answer a question of the user, while commercial search Intents returns products or similar.
Example:

```
What is a dog lead -> Informational search intent

Dog lead -> Commercial search intent
```

### Long tail VS Short tail keywords

Short tail keywords are... short... I mean, for example, you only search one word:

```
Pokemon
```

Long tail keywords are... guess what? Long. Yeah.

```
Buy Pokemon brilliant diamond
```

Of course, short tail keywords will always return more result because of the uncertainty of the search intent.

You usually want to start appearing on the first page of the long tail keywords, and only then start to target the short one.

### SEO Tools

**Google Keyword planner** is a really good tool that helps you choosing the right keywords to add in your site. I highly suggest using it (although you have to create an account on Google ADS).

Another really cool tool is **SEMrush**. I think it's the most complete and useful tool for SEO. The downside is... the price 🥶. But, if you're an agency, you can really consider using it. It helps a lot (anyway, it has a free trial).
In particular, you want to use the _Keyword magic tool_, the _Keyowrd research tool_, and finally the _Keyword Gap Tool_.

One different tool from the other two is **Google Trends**, it's completely free, and basically shows you the trends/interest of a specific topic over time, with a lot of options to filter the state, the keywords, and so on,

Finally, there is **Ubersuggest**. A tool that sits between Google Keyword Planner and SEMrush. It has some free features, but it's not completely free. It's a chrome extension that you can add to get SEO statistics in every search you make.

I was kidding there is another one, but I promise it's the last one: **Answer The Public**. It has a free plan, and basically allows you to know what people is searching about a specific subject. For example, you can type "How to lose weight", and you'll have as a return a lot of topics the people wants to know when they search about it, groupped by "Question" (How, When, Why, What, and so on).

## Conducting keyword research

Before conducting a keyword research you should first consider all this topics:

### Accessing Keywords

We must have some criteria to decide what keywords to use to have an excellent SEO. There are some factors that we need to consider:

* **Search Volume** - the more users search for a specific keyword, the better
* **Competitiveness** - the more website use the same specific keywords, the more will be hard to get first in Search Results.
* **[Keyword Cannibalisation](#keyword-cannibalisation)** - Two page may compete against each other in search results if they have the same kind of page and the same keywords.

### Minimum Seach Volumes

When selecting keywords to target you should target first the long term keywords, because you'll likely have less competition from other websites. Then, you can start targeting short term keywords.

### Example: Finding relevant keywords

Let's get some practice.
We want to improve the SEO of the page: https://www.lovekates.co.uk/cards-by-occasion-birthday-cards/.
It simply sells birthday cards.

First thing we'll do is go into **Google Keyword planner** and search for "_birthday cards_". We'll get a list of useful suggestions, statistics, and other super useful informations.
You should take particular attention to the **search volume** of the keyword.
For the moment, we're done.
This is all we need right now: a list of all relevant keywords that we can use in the website to improve its SEO.

Let's analyze for a moment a particular competitor of LoveKates: https://www.funkypigeon.com/cards/birthday-cards.
This page has a really good SEO. You can guess why just by scrolling down into the "Birthday Card FAQs" Section.
And you'd surely think: "Isn't that a little excessive? I mean... I birthday card is a birthday card"
And, you'd be completely right.
From a user perspective, all this information are a little bit excessive, BUT, from a SEO perspective, this is really good, and allowed FunkyPigeon to be a _top Organic Search Result_ speaking about birthday cards.
So, we should learn from this little example.

Another thing that LoveKates does wrong is the filtering. Technically, it works. But, you can see from the URL something weird. Categories are not aspecific url, but just a list of "parameters" that the server takes and use to filter the products.
From a SEO perspective, this is really bad. You would rather do something like FunkyPigeon, where all the categories are a particular URL that SEO's bots can go and crawl your website (try filtering "birthday cards for sister" to know exactly what i mean).

### Using Google SERPs for Keyword Inspo

You can also simply use the Google Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) to find inspiration about the right keyword. A SERP is simply the page you get when you search something. If you scroll to the bottom of the page you can find a section with "other relevant searches".
There, you can find inspiration about what other users search about that topic or a similar one.

### Brief Index: EAT and YMYL SEO

**EAT** stands for **Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness**, and it belongs to the context of Quality results. This 3 terms are quality factors that Google uses to rank your website.
If you search for a cute cat picture, EAT is not that important. But, if you instead search for indications about a medical consuption, EAT is a fundamental topic, because you must certify that what you write in your website is true and that you can be trusted (remember the achronim: expertise, authoritativeness, trustworthiness).

The same thought can be done for websites where you can Pay for somehting. Google refers to this kind of case as **YMYL**, that stands for **Your Money or Your Life**.

Sometimes Websites can potentially impact a person's future happiness, health, financial stability, or safety. If you're site is built around this topic, demonstrating EAT is crucial.

Let's quickly take a look of each EAT element:

#### Expertise

**Expertise** is the high level of knowledge skill in a particular field, and it's evaluated primarely on the content level, rather than with the organization of the site.
It requires the right qualification and education of the content creator. Formal expertise is really important for YMYL topics, says Google. In Non-YMYL fields, but where a particular form of expertise is still required (e.g. Movie makers, advices on professional fields, and so on), this concepts still applies, and it's all about demonstrating life experiences. This people are what Google call "**Everyday expertise**", and requires less formal expertise.

#### Authoritativeness

**Authoritativeness** is all about reputation, or how experts influence the industry. To evaluate authority Google searchs news articles, recommendations by experts, and this kind of resources.
It's important to remember that authority is a subjective topic.

#### Trustworthiness

**Trustworthiness** is all about legitimacy, transparency, and accuracy of a website and its content. This is particularly important for YMYL queries, but also relevant for other non-YMYL topics.
Having sufficient contact information is also really important, so that if a user have some problems (for example in a transaction), that user can easly rely on you.
By having all of this you can gain the trust of users and, most importantly, of Google.

#### How to evaluate EAT?

You surely are asking yourself: "Ok, but, how does Google evaluate all of this metrics?".
You can follow this points to have a better evaluation of your EAT:

1. **High-quality links** - links to a website that already has a high domain authority
2. **Up to date** - Keep your contents up to date, especially in YMYL topics
3. **More reviews** - Get positive reviews from users to gain trust from them, and let know to Google that they trust you
4. **Show your credentials** - When it comes to demonstrating your EAT to Google, this is precisely what you should do (about page/auto-bio)
5. **Show contact details** - expecially important in YMYL pages

## Content Optimization

We can start talking about **Content Optimization**. This is the process of making sure content is written in a way that it can target a large audience.

But, first of all... WTF is content?

### What is content?

Content is the staff we consume. It's hard to give it a good definition, because it's pretty subjective, but, it can summarized into this:

> Content is Information designed for consumption, seasoned for enjoyment, and packaged to share.

As SEO workers, we should focus on the last part: "\[...] Packaged to share".
The most original and useful content you have, the more users will like to share it everywhere. Google will know if you copy and paste a content from another website, and you will be highly penalized in SEO for this.
So: **Be Original**. Make sure you write informations in your own words.

You may came across two job titles when you want to hire someone to write something in your website:

* Copywriter - someone who is specialized on writing exclusive content that can identify your product/agency/brand and so on.
* Content writer - someone that write blogs, social media posts, captions, and something like this.

### Video, Images, or Text?

When creating content, which is the best type of content from a SEO perspective? Videos, Images, Or Text?

Techically, it's a mix.
Visually good medias (images/videos) can improve engagement from your target audience, but text are what Google whatch more to get what your content is about, so that it can deliver your content to your specific audience.

### Titles

Titles in your pages are really important. I'm not talking about the title in the meta tags of your HTML code, but the titles you use in the page (h1, h2, ...).
Heading are important to capture the user's attention, and the same happens with Google. So, you have to seriously pay attention on what you write in your title tags.

Curiosity: Numbers are really important for the people's mind. They are more digestible, visible, and readable than simple text.
According to studies, brains are attracted to numbers because they can automatically organize informations into a logical order. In particular the number **7** and odd numbers are candies for our organization in mind, and sounds more authentic to a user.

> A number is better than a word.

See this 2 examples:

```
How to make $17,000 a Month Passive Income from Udemy Courses
```

```
How I've Made $305.13 from My First Udemy Course in 12 days.
```

They are both titles of 2 posts in Medium.com. The first post had millions of views and a $1000+ of earnings. The second, only 214 views and $5 of earnings.

### Main Content

Speaking about the main content, consider _always_ this 3 concepts:

* **Attract target audience**
* **Improve Readability**
* **Reducing bounce rate**

If you get this three things right, your SEO performance will improve.
Let's see how we can improve each of them.

#### Attract target audience

This are the things we can do to attract more our target audience (and improve SEO):

1. **First 100 words** - Mention your keywords phrase in the first 100 words.
2. **URL** - Include the target keyword in the page URL (e.g. /sex-toys).
3. **Subheading** - Use your target keyword in at least one sub-heading.
4. **Alt text** - Always use alt text on medias.
5. **Keyword density: 1-2%** - Mention your keyword phrase multiple times in your article.

#### Improve readability

This are the things we can do to improve the readability of our site (and improve SEO):

1. **White space & subheadings** - Make sure the article is "full" of white spaces/padding for easy "scannability".
2. **Text size** - To make sure your site is also visible on mobile, a good rule of thumb is to make the font size at least 16px.
3. **Table of contents** - Below the blog's post, include a table of contents. This will help the user to go strict to a topic, reducing also the boucing of users.
4. **Start with the best** - Put the best topic at the top of the article, so that the user will more likely stick around.


#### Reducing bounce rate

This are the things we can do to reduce the bounce rate of our users (and improve SEO):

1. **Long articles** - Write an article at least twice longer than a compeeting article. They are also preferred by Google.
2. **Update content** - Be sure your content is up to date.
3. **Add internal links** - Add internal links in your content when appropriate. It helps users not bounce around and helps Google to improve the SEO performance.

### Methods for content-writing

SEO is a long game. If you want to succed in this game, you have to re-write constantly your content and keep it up-to-date, updating existing one or (even better) constantly create new contents.
There are a couple of Content Writing methods, that now I'm going to tell you.

#### Army Ant Method

The **Army Ant Method** can be primarely used for higher ranking _blog content_ but also content from _landing pages_.
Here's how it works: find a bunch of question keywords and constantly include them in your articles, mainly in your subheadings (h2) and first 100 words. This way, it will more probable to appear on the first page.
It's called Army Ant method because all of the keywords are pulling in the same direction, supporting one another.
The army ant method is often used when starting a blog.

In practice, using SEMrush, you can, for example, search the keyword "surfboard" and change the filter from "all" to "questions". Now, you can see the most common questions realted to "Surfboard". You can then pick a bunch of those questions and _create new contents based on the questions you picked_.

#### Battleship Method

Another method is the **Battleship Method**. Again, this is primarely used to write blog content, and can help improving visibility if you already have content in your website (this is important).
It's best to have one single comprehensive landing page for each topic, rather than a lot but that covers the same topics:

❌ Landing page about BMW tires, another for BMW engines, and so on.
✅ One landing page for BMW, one for Honda, one for Ducati.

Here's the steps for this method:

1. Study analytics data for your blogs. Find the most searched keyword, and so on.
2. Create more contents about the same (or similar) topic.

### Threading in Keywords

Here there are a bunch of tips:

1. Don't overly target keywords.
2. Use a mix of long and short term keywords.

Identify where it makes sense to use a keyword, and, most importantly, **be natural**: don't force the use of a specific keyword just to improve SEO. You may sound repetetive and lose audience.

### H1s and Title Tags

We alredy said that title tags are really important. Google is getting constantly better at identifying keywords based on the content, but, still, optimizing h1s and titles is never a bad option!
Titles shouldn't be "random". Also, they should respect a specific hierarchy: you should put all H2 tags that has a title related to the parent H1 tag, and the same of other subtitle tags.
Example:

```html
<h1>Flatscreen TVs</h1>
<h2>TV stands</h2>
<h2>TV remotes</h2>
<h2>TV aerials</h2>
```

You should also pay attentions on the meta-description. Altough it's not useful for improving SEO, it surely can increase the audience interest by improving the visual appealeance and, so, get more clicks.
But, meta-titles ARE relevant, and you have to pay attention on them.
The title should have a range of **70 to 120 characters**, and have the most relevant content at the beginning. Also, if there is space, include your brand in the title, so that it will be more visible to other users. Then, cover the most possible keywords combination in your title. Last but not least, write the content "naturally" (first capital letter) to be more "visible" and appealing, and separate keywords with "," or "|" (personal preference).

As always, also look on what competitors are doing.

### Keyword Cannibalisation

We prevously talked a little about **Keyword cannibalisation**, but not enough. Two web pages (in your site!) can compete against each other if they target the same keyword AND have the same type of landing page. To avoid this problem we should try to target unique keywords on our website. However, Keyword Cannibalisation is only an issue when two web pages are competing for the same keywords AND they keep bouncing from one to the other: Google is confused.
What can you do if you spot this issue in one of your pages?

1. De-optimize one of the pages so that it stops competing with the other.
2. Redirect one of the pages to the other.

Before we can implement this solutions, we of course need first to _identify_ the problem.


## Technical SEO

Enough with theory. Let's get practice.
What is **technical SEO**?

> Technical SEO is the process of ensuring our website meets the technical requirements of modern Search Engines with the goal of improving organic rankings.

Important elements in techncial SEO includes:

* **Crawling**
* **Indexing**
* **Rendering**
* **Website architecture**

### Site architecture

Site architecture is how our web pages are structured and linked together. A good site architecture is useful because can help Google and crawlers find faster and easier what they are looking for in a website. It's important for SEO for a number of reasons:

1. Helps find ALL of the pages in your websites. Pages not linked to other web pages in the same site are called **orphan pages**, and it should never happen.
2. Link authority around your webiste.
3. Makes easy for visitors to find what they need.

Your site structure is the first technical aspect you should cover when trying to improve SEO, because it also influence concatenate things, like URLs, Sitemaps, and so on.
Strong structures makes SEO optimizations much easier.

#### Best practices with site architecture

Here are some site architecture best practices:

1. **"Flat" Site architecture** - Flat site architecture is always better: users and SEs can reach any page of your site in 4 clicks or less. In Deep Site Architectures, users have to click 4+ times to go deep in the site, and it's not optimal. You should organize the site in a "wide" way rather than a "deep" way, like this:
![flat and simple architecture](https://api.backlinko.com/app/uploads/2019/02/simple-site-architecture-1.png)
2. **Keep things Simple** - Simplicity is the key of everything. Don't make a second-layer page (like "Topic2" in the prev. example) link to a fourth-layer page, or have more pages that link to the same next-layer page. This makes more difficult to create a clear map of the site. Always go from top to bottom in an organized structure. This also helps in case you have to grow your site. Don't structure your site like this:
![](https://api.backlinko.com/app/uploads/2019/02/complicated-site-architecture-1.png)
You would rather want to strucutre your site like the image in the firs point. That image represent a flat and yet simple architecture.
3. **Logical URL Structure** - Your URL structure should logically follow the structure, just like this example:
`https://example.com/category/subcategory/keyword-keyword`
Also, stay away from long URLs, if you can.
4. **Use internal links** - Your site architecture is determined on how your pages are linked together. Example:
`From Homepage -> Categories -> List of products -> Single product`
This also helps users keeping a mental order on how the site is organized.
5. **Use sitemap** - A sitemap is a good way of increasing a crawlability of your site. It also helps you visualize all categories and sub-categories of your site. This is usually placed in footers. Here's an example (are all links):
    ```
    Category1   Category2   Category3

    sub-1       sub-1       sub-1
    sub-2       sub-2       sub-2
    sub-3       sub-3       sub-3
    ```

We will cover sitemaps more deeply. Sitemaps also make possible to instantly view categories on the SERP.

### Crawl Budget

Crawl budget is simply the number of pages google bots crawl and index on a website in a given timeframe.
Most of website doesn't have to worry about crawl budget, because Google is already good at finding and index pages, but, there are a few cases in which you want to be careful about it:

1. You run a big site
2. You've recently added lots of new pages (in a short time)
3. Lots of redirects

#### Best practices with Crawl Budget

Here are some crawl budget best practices:

1. **Improve Site Speed** - Improving it helps Google bots visiting your site faster, so that they can index more pages.
2. **Use Internal Links** - Your internal links helps bots find all pages
3. **"Flat" Site Architecture** - We spoke about what it is before. It helps crawlers.
4. **Avoid Orphan Pages** - it's connected to a good architecture. Google has a really hard time finding orphan pages, so make sure you always connect each page to another.
5. **Limit Duplicate Content** - Duplicate content is a similar (or exactly the same) content of another page. Google highly penalize this type of pages. This isn't easy, but is a must.

### Sitemaps

A sitemap is a blueprint of your site that helps SE find, crawl, and index your contents. You can think of a sitemap as a physical manifestation of your site architecture.
There are different types of sitemaps:

* **Normal XML sitemap** - the common one, is an XML file that lists all pages in your webiste.
* **Video Sitemap** - Helps Google on video contents of your pages
* **News sitemap** - Helps Google for something like Google news.
* **Image sitemap** - Helps Google find all images in your site.

All of them helps crawlers to better analyze your site. In reality, they can do the same work without relevant difference even without a sitemap, but, it's still better to add at least the normal sitemap.
They are usually useful for _huge_ websites.

#### Best practices with sitemaps
 
Here are some sitemaps best practices:

1. **Create a sitemap** - of course 😀. You can use automatic softwares that do it for you. For example, if you use Wordpress you can use YoastSEO. If you don't, you can use something like Sitemaps.com. The sitemap is usually found at example.com/sitemap.xml (so, at the root).
2. **Make `Sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` work together** - we'll talk about `robots.txt` later.
3. **Break your sitemap into smallet sitemaps** - The maximum number of links in a sitemap is 50,000. Altough is really high, some huge site can still require multiple sub-sitemaps.
4. **Be careful with dates** - Every link has a "Last modified" date. Only change it when that page has a new significant content. Otherwise, Google will take it as a "spam".
5. **Re-submitting a sitemap** - If you would like to know Google about some breaking changes in your site, re-submitting your sitemap is a good option.
6. **Create an HTML sitemap** - It doesn't influence a lot crawlers, but having an HTML sitemap, visible to users, can help you organize content and maybe helps user finding a specific content. This surely won't hurt your SEO performance.

#### Submitting a Sitemap

You can submit your website's Sitemap through the Google Search Console. There is a specific menù about sitemaps, where you can submit one.
Where you upload one, you can also debug some errors (such as Not found URLs) and see a lot of other useful statistics.
Reaaally really simple.

### Robots.txt

`robots.txt` is a file that tells SE crawlers not to crawl certain pages or sections in the website.
It looks something like this:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /wp-admin/
Disallow: /wp-includes/
Disallow: /wp-content/plugins/
Disallow: /wp-content/themes/

Sitemap: http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml
```

The "User-agent" is the name of the bot you're talking to. The asterisk means you want to disallow all user agents, but you could have wrote also something specific like "googlebot".
Really simple.

Not every website need to have a `robots.txt` file, because most SE crwalers already have the capabilities to know which are the most important pages and which one are not to be indexed.
The most common `robots.txt` use cases are:

1. Block non-public pages
2. Maximize crawl budget
3. Prevent indexing of resources

For example, if in your Google Console you notice that there is number of paths indexed that are more than the number of pages in your site, you want to use the `robots.txt` file because probably some resources got indexed too.

The file should be placed in the root, just like the sitemap.

It's really important to format the file properly, otheerwise it will not be valid.

### Page Speed

Page Speed is something that crawlers pay really attention to. Is the amount of time that take a page to completely load.
There are different ways of measuring page speed:

1. Fully loaded page time
2. Time to First Byte
3. First Meaningful Paint

Focus on improving all metrics if you want to improve your SEO.

#### Best Practices in Page Speed

Here there are some best practices you can do to improve your page speed:

1. **Compress images** - they usually take 50-90% of loading page speed 🥸. You can use WP Smush Pro if you're using Wordpress, otherwise something like **Caesium** (really cool).
2. **Clean Code** - Clean and compress your code. Minify everything you can. Also, delete useless resources.
3. **Upgrade Hosting** - The server speed is a really important part of page speed. When it comes to hosting, you get what you're paying for
4. **Activate Browser Caching** - This, of course, won't improve the first-time page loaading, but will improve all the next. So, it's always a good thing!
5. **Implement a CDN** - Content Delivery Networks improve A LOT the page speed of users that are more distant from your server.

#### Measuring PageSpeed

You can measure your page speed using a tool like [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), which is reaaaly easy to use and give you a lot of information on how to improve some specific statistics.

Another realtively new interesting tool is [Think With Google](https://thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/feature/testmysite/). It's focused on the Mobile page speed, so it's useful if you want to improve that side of your application. There you can also compare your page speed with other competitors.

### Duplicate Content

**Google hates duplicate contents**. Duplicate contents are contents that are similar/the same on the same website (even if it's slightly re-written).
Here there are 3 main problems that you can face when duplicating a content:

1. Less Organic Traffic.
2. Penalty (Extremely Rare).
3. Fewer Indexed Pages.

#### Best practices to avoid duplicate contents

Here there are some best practices to avoid duplicate contents:

1. **Whatch For Same Content on Different URLs** - See if other pages of yours have the same content as another.
2. **Check Indexed Pages** - So that you can identify possible missing pages (that are probably non indexed because of duplication).
3. **Make sure your site Redirects Correctly** - It's normal to have an old page with similar content that redirects to a new one with fresh content. Make sure this redicrections happens correctly (or for example if you site switched from `http` to `https`).
4. **Use `301` Redirects** - `301` redicrects are the most efficient way to redirect old pages to a new content.
5. **Keep an eye for similar content** - Google penilize contents that: "Completely match other content or are appreciably similar".
6. **Canonical content** - Use the rel=canonical tag in the HTML code for links, for example:

    ```html
    <link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/sample-page" />
    ```

    The tag tells search engines that, yes, you have pages with duplicate contents, but that can be ignored because there is an original one. The canonical tag, so, mark those pages as duplicates.
7. **Consolidate pages** - If you have pages with similar contents, just consolidate in a single page that wraps everything you need.

### HTTPS vs HTTPS

The protocol you're using is also really important for SEO. HTTP is not considered secure anymore, and Google will penalize A LOT sites that still uses an HTTP protocol.
Nowadays, you're kinda obliged to use HTTPS, because is more secure and can be trusted by users.
The majority of HTTP pages won't be avalable and you'll se a security message in the most modern browsers when trying to acces a page that uses that protocol.
So:

> Always make sure that your site is running on an HTTPS protocol.

#### HTTP Status codes

HTTP status codes are important for SEO. We talked about the `301` status code when speaking about content duplication.
In general:

* **1xx** - The server is "thinking" about the response.
* **2xx** - The response is OK. Request succesfully completed.
* **3xx** - The request has been redirected.
* **4xx** - Client errors.
* **5xx** - Server errors.

From an SEO point of view, these are the most important status codes:

- **200** - Ok.
- **301** - Permanent redirect.
- **302** - Temporary redirect.
- **404** - Not found. Resource missing permanently or just temporary.
- **500** - SEs prefer sites that are well mantained.

To analyze status codes you can use the chrome extension "**Redirect Path**".

### Hreflang tags

Hreflang tags tells Google which language you're using in the current page. A practical example can be this link:

```html
<link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com" hreflang="en-us" />
```

It allows SEs to know what the relationships are from one language to the other. It's useful when creating content that is specific to a specific language audience.

In your head tag of your HTML, you can declare the different langauges you're using, like this example:

```html
<link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com" hreflang="en-us" />
<link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com/fr/" hreflang="fr-fr" />
<link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com/it/" hreflang="it-it" />
```

Also, you need to create tags like this for every page that has an alternate version.

You can even declare a page to be not specifically targeted for a language, but for the user's preferred language, like this:

```html
<link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com" hreflang="x-default" />
```

You can find online some hreflang generators for your site 🏌🏻.

#### Best practices of Hreflang

Here there are some best practices for hreflang tags:

1. **Make sure everything is in the primary language** of the region you are targeting.
2. **Avoid machine translations** (at least, now, in 2022).
3. **Don't automatically redirect users to a different language** based on its location. It's ok to rather suggest another language with a popup.
4. **Stay away from using cookies/scripts** to show different language versions of your page. SEs can't read cookies.

### International SEO

You want of course to be in the first position of all geographical locations that your website covers.
To get that kind of result, you have to pay attention on each language you're handling in your site. Here's some tips:

1. **Content Creation** - Deliver different content based on the geographical location.
2. **Language Targeting (hreflang)** - We covered this already ✅.
3. **Country targeting (URL Structure)** - specify country target in the url.

The last point is what we will focalize in this section.

There are a few options on how you can structure your URL based on the location:

* **ccTLD** (country code Top Level Domain) - Example: `example.it`. They are difficult to mantain, because your site will have different domain authorities, but send strong signals to Search Engines.
* **Subdomain** - Is a child domain of a larger parent domain, like `it.example.com`. You can create multiple subdomains. It's not sure right now if it benefits SEO.
* **Subdirectory / Subfolder** - For example: `example.com/it`. Easy to mantain. However, they send a weak signal to Search Engines 😭.
* **gTLD** (general Top Level Domain) - For example: `example.com/?lang=it-it`. It uses URL's parameters. 
* **Different domain** - Example: `exampleitsite.com`. Meh, I, personally, would never use this technique.

### Mobile SEO

Mobile SEO is the practice of optimize the mobile use of your webiste. Mobile devices nowadays are a lot more used than Desktop, so since 2019 Google decided to consider more and more the Mobile aspects of your websites.

When it comes to making your site mobile-friendly, you have 3 options:

1. **Separate URLs** - Example: `www.example.com` for Desktop, `m.website.com` for Mobiles. They where popular years ago. Today? Meeeh not so much... they are a pain to maintain and are not that good for SEO. I don't reccomend this option.
2. **Dynamic servig** - Send different HTML from the server based on what device they are using. It's definitely better then the previous option, but it has issues. For example: You constantly need to create two separate contents. I don't reccomend this option neither. I'm sorry 😕.
3. **Responsive design** - Waaaay better. This is the optimal choice. You simply have to have different behaviors of your page layout based on the width of the screen. It's also very optimal for SEO (reccomended by Google).

#### Testing Mobile SEO

You can test Mobile SEO in your **Google Cloude Console**, under the voice "_Mobile Usability_". You can find there a lot of informations on how to improve your mobile view of the site.

Also, you can use the [Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) to get other feedbacks about your mobile view.

#### Best practices in Mobile SEO

Here there are some best practices in Mobile SEO:

1. **Google crawl everything** - Don't write in your robots.txt resources that can be important for Mobile!
2. **Get rid of any annoying popup** - They're not good for SEO, and can trigger penalities. Note: this only means that you don't want a popup to cover the whole interface in mobile, but just a small portion! Also, make sure they are easily closable.
3. **Make sure your site is FAST 🔥** - In mobile, the page loading speed is the MAIN important topic to optimize. And it's also extremely hard to get good results 💀.
4. **Easy to Ready Content** - Make sure your content is ridiculously readable in mobile. Big Fonts! Big buttons! Big everything!
5. **HTML5 For Videos** - If you want embedded videos, make sure you're using HTML5
6. **Don't forget the Viewport Content" Tag** - This make sure that your site looks good also in mobile (for responsive design).
7. **Make heading images small** - So that they don't utilize the whole screen.

### Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are a set of specific factors that Google consider important in a web page overall user experience.
CWV are composed by these 3 main things:

* **Largest Contentful Paint** (LCP) - Loading
* **First Input Delay** (FID) - Interactivity
* **Cumulative Layout Shift** (CLS) - Visual Stability

You can find your Web Vitals data in your Google Console.

Anyway, Google says that "A good page experience doesn't override having great, relevant content."

#### Largest Contentful Paint

**The Largest Contentful Paint** (LCP) is how long it takes a page to load from the point of view of the actual user. In other words, the time from cliccking on a link to see the majority of the contents in the screen. So, Being able to _see_ and _interact_.

Here some generic guidelines to improve LCP:

* Remove any unnecessary third-party scripts
* Upgrade your web host (better hosting)
* Set up lazy image loading (images load ONLY when they are in the viewport)
* Remove large page elements
* Minify your scripts (CSSs, JSs)

#### First Input Delay

**First Input Delay** (FID) is the time that takes a user to actually interact with the page (clicking on buttons, navigating, and so on).

Here some generic guidelines to improve FID:

* Minimize (or defer) Javascript
* Remove any non-critical third-party scripts
* Use browser cache

#### Cumulative Layout Shift

**Cumulative Layout Shift** (CLS) is, visually speaking, how stable the page is when it loads. You don't want to have an element that renders in the page above the others, in a later time, making it _shift_ all other elements down. This can cause some problems in the user experience. You want your page elements to be stable, so that you don't click on something by mistake.

Here some generic guidelines to avoid CLS:

* Use set size attribute dimensions for any media
* Ad elements have a reserved space

## Domains

There are not "rules" on how you should name your domain, and, most importantly, the name of your domain it's not relevant in a SEO perspective.
Anyway, it's usually a good practice to have a domain name that is simple to remember for the user, composed by 2 words (maximum) and that represent your brand.

About the "www", it's really irrelevant if you choose to have it or not. Just stay consistent. Also, Google will treat links with the same domain but with/without "www" as separate websites, so keep an eye about _duplicate content_!

You can search a good domain name in tools like [leandomainsearch.com](https://leandomainsearch.com) and [bustname.com](https://bustname.com).

Quick note: a cool tool is "[Archive.org](https://web.archive.org)" let's you see how a page in a domain changed over the years, and also how much that page was "popular" over time (try with "google.com"! 🫣).

## Backlinks

Ok. What are **Backlinks**? And why are they _so important_?
A backlink is simply a _mention_ of your website in another website. You can think of it like the "@" symbol in a social media app.
In SEO they are Really, really, really important. For real.
Backlinks tell Google something like "_Well, if another website mentions it, it must be good!_".
This also add **trustness** and **link authority** of your site, which is really important for YMYL sites.
Backlinks are so important that actually 4 backlink's factors are mentioned in the "most important factors that influence SEO".
The more websites mentions yours, the more your site will have an extremely good SEO.

But, of course, you can still get mentions on 1000 sites and still not have a good SEO. Why? Because what matters more is not the number of sites that mentions you, but the "quality" of the sites that does. You can check the **Domain rating** scale of a site on [Moz Domain Authority](https://moz.com/domain-analysis), to see how much that site is relevant to your SEO.

Providing a link needs 3 criteria, which are the following:

* **Relevance** - how relevant is the link
* **Power** - The more, the better
* **Trust** - Can we trust the website we are linked to?

### Anchor texts

Anchor texts in Backlinks are actually really important too, because Google see and analyze them. If a site mentions you in a link with the text: "The most horrible site here :D", it will surely not be a good thing 🧐.
Also, if there are duplicates/similar texts on different sites, Google will think you're trying to force the system to improve your SEO, and the only result you'll get will be a penalization 😀.
Note that having your brand's name in the link's text will be positive, and so with generic texts (read more, click here, and so on).

### Do-Follow vs No-Follow Backlings

In HTML, Do-Follow links look like this:

```html
<a href="https://www.pokemon.com">
```

Non-Follow links are similar, with the only difference of the "rel" attribute:

```html
<a href="https://www.pokemon.com" rel="nofollow">
```

The difference is simply that with No-follow links we're _refusing_ to pass any of our link uses through the pokemon's website.
Why would you want to do this?
Well, of course, if you don't want to improve a competitor's SEO 😈 (Yeah I'm not kidding).

You can check your Backlinks analytics on SEMrush.

### Websites You Want Links From

Here there are 4 check I reccomend going through to decide rather a website is worth talking for a link.

1. **Web Authority** - Does the website have an authority over 25? Higher is always gold.
2. **Keywords** - How much different keywords does our website rank for? Ideally, you're looking for > 100.
3. **Monthly visitors** - You want at least to be linked to a website with > 200 monthly _organic_ visitors.
4. **Referring Domains** - At least 50 referring domains. This suggest Google that it's getting links naturally.

You can check the domain authority (DA) of websites also in the SERP if you have installed the Ubersuggest chrome extension, or you can go in [ahrefs](https://ahref.com) and check the specific URL you're searching for.

### Link Building

There are actually various Link Building strategies:

1. **[Guest Posting](#guest-posting)**
2. **[Taking Competitor Backlinks](#taking-competitor-backlinks)**
3. **[Resource Link Building](#resource-link-building)**
4. **[Broken Link Building](#broken-link-building)**
5. **[Skycraper Link Building](#skycraper-link-building)**

Here the steps to follow for each strategy 🤓:

#### Guest Posting

**Guest Posting** on other websites - You can guest post on other websites that support that feature, so that you can then name your brand in that post. Here's the step to follow.

1. Search on Google: \[NICHE] "submit a guest post" (the double quotes are important! Also, replace \[NICHE] with your custom search).
2. Check potential sites on SEMrush.
3. Track these websites in a spreadsheet (with URL, DA, Referring Domains, Traffic, Keywords. You can find these info in SEMrush).
4. Send unique content to each website (or contact them to ask to feature your brand)
5. Use an email outreach template if a website doesn't have a form

#### Taking Competitor Backlinks

In the "**Taking Competitor Backlinks**" stategy you have to follow this steps:

1. Find Competitors, by searching a generic keyword that competitors may have, or do a "brand search", so search for a brand you are being "inspired" from and see where they get the backlinks from.
2. Check out the backlink profiles of comptetitor sites (on SEMrush)
3. Compile a list of websites we may be able to guest post on
4. Contact these websites to see if we can guest post on them, and put some unique content, featuring also our brand

#### Resource Link Building

**Resource Link Building** works like this:

1. Find relevant resource pages that provide useful links to help websites.
2. Search on Google: \[NICHE] "useful resources" (the double quotes are important! Also, replace \[NICHE] with your custom search).
3. Reach out to websites that have these resource pages, sending an email that says that their website is _B E A U T I F U L_, but that can be even more beautiful if in that "resources page" there is also a link to our brand 😎.

#### Broken Link Building

**Broken Link Building** strategy is almost the most favorite to SEO experts, because it's the most quick, and tangible way of bringing value to website's owners:

1. Find relevant resource pages (just like in the step 2 of [Resource Link Building](#resource-link-building).
2. Find broken links on pages using the "Check My Links" chrome extension, and suggest a fix by creating a blog with a content similar to that broken link (you can know what it was by using "[Wayback Machine](https://archive.org)"), so that you can fix it.
3. Track these websites in a spreadsheet.

I know, I know, It may sound "evil", but it's actually a good strategy 😅.

#### Skyscraper Link Building

**Skyscraper Link Building** (no, it's not misspelled), works like this:

1. Find a relevant piece of content with lots of backlinks (ideally 80+ referring domains)
2. Create something even better 😎. How?
    * Add more information
    * More fresh content with cool images
    * New, mega-super-cool design
    * Go deeper into arguments.
3. Ask to link to your superior content instead.

## Monitoring Keywords

The ideal tool for keywords tracking, is, guess what? Of course, SEMrush. But, if you're trying to opt for something cheaper, [Serprobot](https://www.serprobot.com) can be the ideal choice (only for keyword tracking). You also have 14 day trials.
But, with SEMrush you can also check comptetitor's Ranking using the "Keyword Gap" tool, tracking your backlinks, see which of your keywords gets more click to your site (so cool :D), and many other things. So... come on...
No, I swear, I'm not trying to sponsorize [SEMrush](https://www.semrush.com) (click on the link! 😏).
No ok I'm kidding. But, really, SEMrush it's so useful and full of contents that is worth the price.

In SEO, there is always a big, big question:

> How long does it take to see results?

It depends on many factors, but, usually, months. Results aren't even garanteed, but **patience**, and **consistency** are the keys. You have to build trust and authority, and this isn't an easy work.

> What if... Rankings are not improving? 😱

Something probably gone wrong along the way. Here's the most 3 common "errors", and how you can fix them:

1. **OVER-optimised anchor text** - check your spreadsheet on where you wrote all the links to keep track of. Don't write the same thing over and over in different places. Remember how bad duplication is?
2. **UNDER-optimised anchor text** - The opposite problem. Open up your spreadsheet and mention more of your keywords. Then, spread those links all over the world
3. **Keyword density Too High** - If you repeat over and over your keywords, Google can penalize you. Stay natural. Always.

## SEO Audits

What are SEO Audits? An SEO Audit is the process on evaluating websites to see how search friendly it is. You can think of it like visiting a new doctor for the first time, they'll make a check to know your past medical condition.

Google does the same thing by sendin a Crawl bot that analyze trillions of pages across the world wide web. It then separate the pages in 3 categories: 

* **Known Pages** - Pages Google knows about, but hasn't do anything about
* **Crawled Pages** - Google analyze the page: check texts, layout, to decide where it should appear on search results.
* **Indexed Pages** - Google tries to understand what the page is about. This information is then stored on Google's databases.

### Tools

As an SEO Engineer, of course, you need a tool that allows you to crawl a website. There are actually 2 main tools: **[Deep Crawl](https://www.lumar.io/)**, and **[Screaming Frong](https://screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider)**.

We'll focus on the second one, because the name it's more funny.
You can accurately check what it does by clicking on the previous link.

To get started, you just have to paste the "main" link (home) of a domain we want to look at. It will then return all the pages related to that domain, with really a LOT of informations (A LOT!), and you can also see the Site structure. It's pretty cool 🤓.
Most importantly, you can also see the [crawl Depth](#best-practices-with-site-architecture) (the number of click to go deep down into your site).

A cool and useful feature, if you are a more visual person, it's the "Crawl Tree Graph" tool under the "visualization" tab. It will show a visual display of the site structure.

### Optimize URLs

From an SEO perspective, the first think you wanna look at when auditing a website, are **URLs**.
We're going to break it down into 2 stages:

1. Identify dead pages (404 pages).
2. URL optimization if a page it's ranking for a target keyword. To do this we'll consider the following criteria (ONLY IF THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF _BACKLINKS_ POINTING TO IT!):

    * Target Keyword in the URL
    * No keyword stuffing
    * The shorter, the better
    * Don't repeat stuff

So, using Screaming Frog, the steps to follow to optimize your pages are this:

* Export the excel of your website to audit
* Search 404 pages. See if they should be removed (not always is necessary if they are not "important")
* Search 301 pages
* Search 200 pages (OK), and filter only the indexable pages that have "text/html" as a content-type
* Optimize the URLs as said before.

### Title Tags

We've already seen previosly how to optimize **title tags**, but this time we'll be focus on using Screaming Frog to do that.
To know which title tags we want to improve, we have to consider this common criterias:

* Keeping under 60 characters (including spaces).
* Target Keywords to the front of the title tag
* Include single words/variations of your keywords
* Don't repeat words and write natually

To analyze title tags, you have to do the same operations as [URLs](#optimize-urls), but you have to check the **title 1** and **Title 1 Length** columns on indexable pages. Then, optimize them as above.

### Meta Descriptions

**Meta Descriptions** are the lines of text underneath the title tag in SERPs. It't a good idea to write them in the main pages, but it's not necessary to write them on blogs: Google it's pretty smart and will place itself a description based on the content you wrote.

Anyway, here there are some good practices about meta tags:

* Keeping under 155 characters (including spaces)
* Mention your keywords in the description
* Grab people's attention with questions
* Write naturally

To audit meta descriptions, again, you have the same steps as [URLs](#optimize-urls) and [Title tags](#title-tags).
So, filter all the pages and see the meta description of them. Then, apply your corrections.

### Heading tags

Also with **Heading tags** (h1, h2) there are some criterias:

* Include your main keyword in the H1
* Have only one h1 tag per page
* Write naturally

And agaaaaaain, you can find info about all the H1s in Screaming Frog. Follow the steps as in [URLs](#optimize-urls) and adapt the columns to only consider the h1 tags.

### Audit presentation

When working to optimize a site, you usually want to make a cool presentation about what should be done to improve SEO, and show it to your boss.
In this kind of presentation, you should cover this 3 topics:

* **Technical issues** - URL structure | Attribute issues | Sitemap issues | H1s in Header Images | Duplicate Title Tags | Slow Page Speed
* **Content issues** - Keyword strategy | Thin Content on CLPs (core landing pages), all pages affected and rankings | Under-Optimised Content on CLPs | Blog recommendations
* **Off-site Issues** - Backlink Analysis, quantity and quality | Link-Building Campaigns

Of course, for each topic and correlated issue, explain in a detailed way the issue and the solution to it, the tools you used to find those issues and the way you worked.

## Site Migrations

Site migration is a really sensitive topic, becuase if anything go wrong you can potentially loss keywords and SEO rankings in general.
So, you want to be careful. _Extremely_ careful.

The reasons to migrate a site can be a lot, but this is a techincal topic, which I'm not going to cover here. We'll cover instead the Site Migration only from a SEO engineer perspective.

Site migrations have strategies to address crucial technical issues like:

* **Baseline metrics** of keyword rankings
* Putting **Redirects** in place
* **Analytics & Reporting**
* **Duplicate content**

Before we go into the migration process with more details, we have to make some check I recommend taking 2-3 month before launch:

1. **Pick a Smart Launch Date** for your site migration (website traffic, ...).
2. **Backup Your site**, so you can revert your website if needed.
3. **Create a Staging Website** (duplicate website that users don't see).
4. **Check the new Domain's Health**, because if the domain has been used in the past, it can possibly penalize your new content if that domain had a "bad reputation".
5. **Benchmark the Performance of your Old Website** (in a SEO perspective, so check backlinks, keywords, ranking, and so on).

SEMrush have all the tools to keep track of the necessary metrics to do this job with 100% accuracy. You can use all you've learned previously to have a sucesfull redirection.

### Pre Launch

Here some pre-launch steps you should do (at least 1 week to go):

1. "Copy" across Top-performing Blogs.
2. Complete a Site Audit of the site Staging Site:
    * Broken pages (4xxs)
    * Redirects (3xxs)
    * Broken images
    * Missing meta tags
    * Duplicate content
    * No or incorrect canonical tags
    * Pages not "noindex"ed
3. Test for Broken Links.
4. Keep Control of your Old Domain.
5. Create a custom 404 Page.

We already seen previosuly how you can do all of that things. Now you just have to apply your knowledge.

### Launch day

Here some checks you should make in the launch day:

1. Check redirects are working
2. Check `robots.txt` file is as expected
3. Check the \<noindex> tag has been removed from your pages
4. Tell Google Search Console You Changed Your Domain
5. Check XML Sitemap is as expected
6. Upload XML Sitemap to Search Engines
7. Complete a Site Audit of the new Site
8. Correct Title Tags & Meta Descriptions
9. Test for Broken Links (again)
10. No Soft 404s (no 404 that actually returns a 200 status code!)
11. Check Analytics Codes are in place
12. Test on Mobile
13. Test Integrations
14. Update Social Profiles
15. Update "Google My Business"
16. Make a party because you got the job done

### Post Launch

Here some checks you should make after you succesfully launched your webiste (1-7 days after launch):

1. Make sure pages are getting traffic
2. Make sure you're tracking keywords on tools like SEMrush or similar.
3. Check your analytics, comparing pre and post migration.
4. Search Indexing issues in the Google Search Console regularly
5. Pay attention to 404 traffics
6. See if all backlinks work properly (using a tool like SEMrush or similar).

## Conclusions

Another chapter done. Congratulations to you and your multiple personalities if you read all of this.
I know you initially thought SEO would have been an easy topic to learn, but, just like you have seen so far, it's not as easy as you thought and you have to keep an eye on a lot of things.

Again, good Job, you are now an SEO Senior Engineer :)
